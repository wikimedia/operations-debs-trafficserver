 -- Arno Töll <arno@debian.org>  Tue, 29 Jan 2013 23:54:44 +0100

trafficserver (3.2.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    + If you are using SSL or HTTP filtering, please update your configuration.
      proxy.config.http.quick_filter.mask  and
      proxy.config.ssl.server.cert.filename is not recognized anymore. Please
      use ip_allow.config and ssl_multicert.config respectively instead.
      There is no automated migration for this in Debian, as this affects your
      site-specific configuration files.
    + See https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/TS/Upgrading+to+3.2 for
      full upgrade instructions.
  * Upstream decided to ship more plug-ins with the trafficserver core
    distribution. These are all bundled into the main package now. Therefore,
    the trafficserver-plugin-conf-remap package is not provided anymore.
  * Update the default configuration file to ship with more moderate values
    for the log configuration.
  * Now do start ATS by default for fresh installations. The default
    out-of-the box configuration is much more secure than past defaults.
  * Purge the host and data cache on upgrades
  * Let's welcome Aron Xu to the Uploaders of Trafficserver. Hi Aron! :)

trafficserver (3.0.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * No kudos for the previous hostile NMU, but include the changelog to denote
    this upload does not introduce a regression.
  * Update my maintainer address
  * Make the init script look much better when using fancy outputs.
  * Fix "status" output of the init script
  * Remove "DM-Upload-Allowed". I don't need that flag anymore.

trafficserver (3.0.4-1.1) unstable; urgency=low

trafficserver (3.0.4-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream release
    + Fix CVE-2012-0256: A request with a very large Host header caused ATS to
      crash.
  * Setting urgency to high because of security updates
  * Push standards to 3.9.3 - no further changes
  * Stilistic adaptions in debian/copyright, but not content changes
  * Remove cluster interface warning from README.Configuration. ATS now binds on
    lo by default

 -- Arno Töll <debian@toell.net>  Wed, 21 Mar 2012 12:34:35 +0100

trafficserver (3.0.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    + Includes former Debian specific patch which makes sure the upstream
      configure script does not override any -O flags passed by the user
      anymore.
  * Adapt to dpkg 1.16.1 API changes regarding build flags. This enables
    hardening build flags. This means, trafficserver is now being built with
    -fstack-protector and other security related build flags.
  * Add dpkg-dev (>= 1.16.1~) to build-depends to make sure our buildflags are
    properly supported. That's guaranteed for Testing, but might be helpful to
    know for backporters.
  * Fix several issues in the DEP-5 syntax. Unfortunately there is no way to
    express that a file is subject to different license agreements so far.
  * Do not install the upstream changelog twice anymore
  * Finally run regression checks again, now as build failures are sorted out.

 -- Arno Töll <debian@toell.net>  Sun, 11 Dec 2011 00:45:45 +0100

trafficserver (3.0.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix "please add armhf to the arch list" - add armhf to the list of supported
    architectures. Thanks Konstantinos Margaritis for the hint (Closes: #636338)
  * Remove IA64 from the list of supported architectures. The upgrade to the gcc
    4.6 toolchain disclosed portability issues with it, which caused the resul-
    ting binary package to produce no-op code in some functions. 

 -- Arno Töll <debian@toell.net>  Tue, 02 Aug 2011 22:58:37 +0200

trafficserver (3.0.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. Fixes several important issues which caused

    committed upstream. Thanks Ilya Barygin (Closes: #632546)
  * Fix "trafficserver: Getting rid of unneeded *.la / emptying
    dependency_libs", remove *.la files from the installation target completely
    (Closes: #633192)
  * Set "DM-Upload-Allowed: yes" in agreement with Asheesh Laroia
    <paulproteus{at}debian.org>

 -- Arno Töll <debian@toell.net>  Mon, 01 Aug 2011 19:29:58 +0200

trafficserver (3.0.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. Major changes (since 2.1.9):
    + `traffic_server' won't crash anymore when using non-existent plugin in
      remap rule
    + Don't cache HTTP 401, 303 and 407 error responses anymore, when negative
      caching is enabled.
  * Re-enable kfreebsd support, it was accidentally not available in
    2.1.9-unstable-1 because of non installable dependencies, as libcap-dev is
    installable (and required) on Linux only
  * debian/rules:
    + Simplify dh_auto_configure flags (upstream incorporated our build layout)
    + Enable WCCP (Web Cache Communication Protocol; Linux only)
  * debian/control:
    + Add flex and bison to build dependencies, both are required for WCCP
      (Linux only)

 -- Arno Töll <debian@toell.net>  Wed, 15 Jun 2011 15:56:29 +0200

trafficserver (2.1.9-unstable-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. Major features (since 2.1.8):
    + Bring back support for $DESTDIR and "make check" which makes Debian
      patches obsolete
    + Allow larger working sets than 512G
    + Disable cluster autodiscovery when cluster mode is disabled
    + Cleanup `records.config'
    + Disable SSLv2 by default
  * debian/control: Add build dependency to libcap-dev, because when running
    traffic_server standalone, it is unable to bind restricted ports otherwise
    (Upstream: TS-804)
  * debian/rules:
    + Remove override for dh_clean, but put options to debian/source/options
      instead
    + Remove DH_OPTIONS (unused anyway)
  * Source package: Minor change to improving package quality and usability
    (i.e. grammar, verbosity of comments)
  * Make the init script more robust
  * Base the origin of the package source on the untouched upstream tarball,
    instead of the versioned SVN branch.
  * Bring back IA64 support, this time actually working (upstream merged my
    patch TS-783)
  * Remove patch `build-quirks.patch'. Changes have been committed upstream
    by now.

    + traffic_shell does not hang anymore on any command
  * Fix "FTBFS on architectures not supported upstream": (Closes: #622800)
    + Don't execute regression checks for now (fixes x86)
    + Upstream merges a Debian patch originally for 2.1.7 which enables
      kFreeBSD support (originally provided by myself)
    + Restrict Architectures (drop S390, IA64, MIPS[EL], PPC, SPARC)
  * Remove ts-ui-disable-conf.patch (applied upstream)
  * Update `build-quirks.patch' to make TS handle $DESTDIR correctly
    (upstream: TS-759)
  * Remove .deps from SDK binary package examples (they were incidentally
    included before).
  * Fix permissions for /var/cache/trafficserver in postinst
  * Bump standards to 3.9.2, depend on debhelper 8.0, adapt VCS links
  * Simplify debian/rules

 -- Arno Töll <debian@toell.net>  Thu, 05 May 2011 21:49:52 +0200

trafficserver (2.1.5-unstable-1) unstable; urgency=low
