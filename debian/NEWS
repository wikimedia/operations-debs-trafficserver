trafficserver (3.0.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * If you are upgrading from v2.1.8 or earlier to ATS 3.0 you need to migrate
    to the new `records.config' configuration file. If possible, let Debian
    overwrite your `records.config' configuration file.
  * Moreover you should clear all caches after upgrading (e.g. do "traffic_server
    -Cclear").
  * The host.db data abse isn't required anymore. Therefore you can delete
    `/etc/trafficserver/internal/hostdb.config' and `/var/cache/trafficserver/
    host.db'.
