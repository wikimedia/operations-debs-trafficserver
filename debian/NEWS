trafficserver (6.0.0-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  If you are using 32-bits package, please not that upstream has
  discontinued 32-bit support.
  32-bits Debian package will still be built, but is subject to removal
  whenever 32-bit fails.

trafficserver (3.0.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  If you are upgrading from v2.1.8 or earlier to ATS 3.0 you need to migrate
  to the new `records.config' configuration file. If possible, let Debian
  overwrite your `records.config' configuration file.

  Moreover you should clear all caches after upgrading (e.g. do "traffic_server
  -Cclear").

  The host.db data abse isn't required anymore. Therefore you can delete
  `/etc/trafficserver/internal/hostdb.config' and `/var/cache/trafficserver/
  host.db'.
