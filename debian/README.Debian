trafficserver for Debian
------------------------

* ATS 8.0.0 comes with slight changes in config files.
    Following ones has been removed:
    - /etc/trafficserver/vaddrs.config
    - /etc/trafficserver/metrics.config
    - /etc/trafficserver/logging.config
    - /etc/trafficserver/log_hosts.config
    - /etc/trafficserver/congestion.config
    - /etc/trafficserver/cluster.config
    - /etc/trafficserver/body_factory/default/congestion#retryAfter

* New config files have been added and now use yaml format.
    More files will be migrated in the future:
    - /etc/trafficserver/logging.yaml
    - /etc/trafficserver/ssl_server_name.yaml

* gzip pluging has been renamed into compress.
    Existing configuration won't be updated

* traffic_cop has been removed. Now, init and systemd files use traffic_manager

* If you are using 32-bits package, please note that upstream has
    discontinued 32-bit support.
    32-bits Debian package will still be built, but is subject to removal
    whenever 32-bit fails.

* Please read the CONFIGURATION.Debian file to get started with Traffic Server.

* Currently Apache Traffic Server lacks man pages of binaries shipped along the
  package. That's a known problem which is being worked on. Please read the
  upstream documentation on the website instead.

* If you read upstream's documentation about Traffic Server you will sometimes
  find references to a program `/usr/bin/trafficserver`. Debian does not ship
  this script. This is intentional. Use Debian's /etc/init.d/trafficserver
  script instead.
