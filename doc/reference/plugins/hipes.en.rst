    Default: ``url``
    Name of the query parameter for the service URL

``path:<path>``
    Default: ``/``
    Path to use for the service URL

``ssl``
    Default: ``no``
    Use SSL when connecting to the service

``service``
    Service server, ``host[:port]``

``server``
    Default: ``hipes.yimg.com``
    Name of HIPES server, ``host[:port]``

``active_timeout``
    The active connection timeout in ms

``no_activity_timeout``
    The no activity timeout in ms

``connect_timeout``

only apply to the connection to the specific "service" host.
