=============
plugin.config
=============

.. configfile:: plugin.config

The :file:`plugin.config` file controls run-time loadable plugins available
to the Traffic Server, as well as their configuration.

Example
=======

::

     # Comments start with a '#' and continue to the end of the line
     # Blank lines are ignored
     #
     # test-plugin.so arg1 arg2 arg3
     #
     plugins/iwx/iwx.so
     plugins/abuse/abuse.so etc/trafficserver/abuse.config
     plugins/icx/icx.so etc/trafficserver/icx.config

Each configuration line consists of a path to an ``.so`` file. This path
can either be absolute, or relative to the plugin-directory (usually
``/usr/local/libexec/trafficserver``). Such a line tells Traffic Server
to load said plugin.

A plugin can have any number of configuration parameters listed. Please
refer to our `plugins' documentation <../plugins>`_ for their reference.

Plugins should only be listed *once*. The order in which the plugins are
listed is also the order in which they are chained for the processing.
