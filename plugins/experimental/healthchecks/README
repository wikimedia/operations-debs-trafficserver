This is a simple plugin, to provide basic (but configurable) health checks.
This is a server intercept plugin, and it takes one single  configuration
option in plugin.config, the configuration file name. 

This configuration contains one, or several, lines of the format

   <URI-path> <file-path> <mime> <file-exists-code> <file-missing-code>


For example,

   /__hc  /var/run/ts-alive  text/plain 200  403


The content of the file, if any, is sent as the body of the response.
